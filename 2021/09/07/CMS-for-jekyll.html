<p>Alright, so tbh, I kinda hate Jekyll, it just seems too old. I guess Eleventy, Hugo, Gatsby are way better for generating static websites. But anyways, I came to Jekyll because I wanted to experience something other than javascript.</p>

<p>In my last post, I discovered that I couldnâ€™t easily put images etc. into my blogpost and hence was unable to explain or show some things that I would have wanted to. So to solve that issue, I tried three things.</p>
<h2 id="contentful">Contentful</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> is a service which allows you to manage a headless CMS which your static site generator (such as Jekyll) can use to pull in data. I found the following useful links about how I could use Contentful with my website, however, I eventually gave up on trying to use it.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://katiekodes.com/jekyll-api-headless-cms/">Katie Kodesâ€™ article</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/contentful/jekyll-contentful-data-import">Contentfulâ€™s jekyll plugin</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="netlify-cms">Netlify CMS</h2>
<p>The great Netlify had way better docs and guidance than Contentful, but I didnâ€™t wanna switch over my blog to netlify because I was already using it for some other websites and wanted to get more accustomed to Github Pages and Github Actions. Here are some useful links tho:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/jekyll/">Netlify CMS Jekyll Docs</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site">Netfliy CMS General Add to Site Docs</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="jekyll-admin">Jekyll Admin</h2>
<p>After trying my luck with both CMSs above, I remembered that I had come across Jekyll Admin <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin/">repo</a> when I was browsing the Jekyll organization on github once. So I decided to give it a go. It seems pretty simple to use and also fulfills all my requirements. Although there is one requirement that I want to still test. Does it allow me to put in images without any effort? Letâ€™s test it rn.</p>

<p>And no, we canâ€™t add it easilly. So I guess this whole thing was a failure. Follow me for more disappointing experiences like this ðŸ¥²</p>
