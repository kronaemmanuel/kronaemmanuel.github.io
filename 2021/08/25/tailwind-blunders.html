</p>

<p>So I‚Äôm trying to setup my tailwindcss to work properly and I‚Äôm constantly getting this error:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  Conversion error: Jekyll::Converters::Scss encountered an error while converting 'assets/css/styles.scss':
  Error: unterminated attribute selector for type on line 632:16 of styles.scss &gt;&gt; .prose ol[type="A" s] { ---------------^
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And I wasn‚Äôt sure why I was getting this error. But then I compared my code to the repo of the guide I was following to do this by <a href="https://katiekodes.com/jekyll-tailwind">Katie Kodes</a>. I realized that the Katie was importing the tailwind styles into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.css</code> file while I was doing it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.scss</code>. So I changed my extension from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.scss</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.css</code></p>

<p>Also, I found this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68898511/tailwindcss-typography-sasscsyntaxerror-error-unterminated-attribute-select/68898512#68898512">Stack Overflow issue</a> which was the same as mine. The guy who wrote the question answered his own question and reasoned that ‚Äúthis new syntax for CSS rules is not supported by libsass / sassc.‚Äù so hence the error.</p>

<p>Well, I tried to understand what this meant and found this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I thought that the issue was with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[type="A" s]</code> part, maybe that was something new in the CSS Spec (I haven‚Äôt seen this syntax before). And maybe this wasn‚Äôt handled by Scss yet. However, the CSS attribute selector of the type: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.prose ol[type="A" s]</code> have been around since 2018. These <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/">specs</a> were last updated in 2018. So I guess it‚Äôs not that issue.</li>
  <li>I also created a <a href="https://codepen.io/StoryMode/pen/XWgJmrj">Codepen</a> to see if Scss created this error in a setup other than Jekyll. I set SCSS as my CSS preprocessor in it. However, it didn‚Äôt cause any errors, and worked.</li>
  <li>The Stack Overflow guy had mentioned ‚Äúlibsass‚Äù and ‚Äúsassc‚Äù. I found that LibSass was <a href="https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated">deprecated</a> from the Sass‚Äôs blog. Also found that they now use Dart Sass, which was surprising to me, I didn‚Äôt know that Sass was using Dart. Go Dart!</li>
  <li>Another thing that made me curious is that the error is about the selector being unterminated. I switched the preprocessor in my Codepen from <a href="https://codepen.io/StoryMode/pen/OJgPyyd">Scss to Sass</a>, and it gave me an error, that it was expecting a end of line. Ofcourse it did, Sass does away with the squiggly braces, so ofcourse it gave me that error. Which makes me think, does jekyll use Sass or does it use Scss? ü§î In the error message I see that the error is created by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jekyll::Converters:Scss</code> which I guess means that its an Scss compiler, but then why would it not parse valid CSS code. Anywho, that‚Äôs as far as I‚Äôm gonna pursue this. Its late, I should be asleep by now.</li>
</ol>

<p>Edit: Nevermind I found the reason why this wasn‚Äôt working. You can read all about it <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sass-converter/issues/120#issuecomment-889739369">here</a></p>
