      <h1>Making Github Actions Work</h1>

</p>

<p>After finishing my tailwind blogpost yesterday, I realized that it didn’t actually publish and that my github action setup to deploy the websitewasn’t working. I had followed the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/">guide</a> on Jekyll’s own website to make the github action, but it wasn’t working.</p>

<p>I quickly realized that the action I had created didn’t support npm or Node. So I had to set that up myself, after trying it and failing too many times, I finally hit a vein of gold. I found this <a href="https://githubmemory.com/repo/mhanberg/jekyll-postcss/issues/20">issue</a> by a lovely person named DavidUnzue. He was facing the exact same issue that I was facing, so I’m not describe the issue in detail here. Anyways, someone else and him had figured out how to solve it. And I followed his advice of using a <a href="https://github.com/limjh16/jekyll-action-ts">different</a> github action and also running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> before it. And voila! My <a href="https://github.com/kronaemmanuel/kronaemmanuel.github.io/actions/runs/1168075987">github action</a> started working! You can check out the github action history before the linked action to see all the times I failed. 15 times to be exact.</p>

<p>Anyways, I realized that I had much to learn about github actions, and even more to learn about docker.</p>
